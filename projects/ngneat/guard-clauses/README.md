# Guard

This library was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 10.0.14.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name --project guard-clauses` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard-clauses|interface|enum|module --project guard-clauses`.

> Note: Don't forget to add `--project guard-clauses` or else it will be added to the default project in your `angular.json` file.
